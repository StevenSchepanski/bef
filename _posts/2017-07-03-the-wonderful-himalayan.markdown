Got rid of the nonsense paragraph.

Let's try another paragraph. Cool I think this seems to be working
What does it do when I hop onto an new line like that?

<!-- So the following gets you a nice quote: -->
> Write the quote here <cite>- Name of person being quoted</cite> 

<!-- Trying to add an image -->

<!-- Trying to add a link -->

<!-- Trying to add a file -->

Another plain text RANDOM paragraph...
And end the article
